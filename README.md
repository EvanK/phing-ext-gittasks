# What?

Additional **git** related tasks for the [phing](http://phing.info/) build tool.

# Why?

Phing currently comes with several tasks for interacting with **git** repositories, but it also lacks some that I have a need for.  Thus, I am implementing them myself by extending phing's provided `GitBaseTask` class.  Once I have them in a decent working state, I plan on submitting them to phing's maintainers for inclusion in a future release.
