# What?

Additional **git** related tasks for the [phing](http://phing.info/) build tool.

# Why?

Phing currently comes with several tasks for interacting with **git** repositories, but it also lacks some that I have a need for.  Thus, I am implementing them myself by extending phing's provided `GitBaseTask` class.  I've implemented them more or less, and [have submitted them to the phing maintainers](http://phing.info/trac/ticket/618) for inclusion in a future release.
